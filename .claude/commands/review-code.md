# Review Code

Perform comprehensive code review and provide improvement suggestions.

## Usage

Use this command when you need to:
- Review pull requests or code changes
- Audit existing code for quality issues
- Get suggestions for refactoring
- Ensure code follows best practices

## Instructions for Claude

1. **Code Quality Analysis**:
   - Check for code clarity and readability
   - Identify potential bugs or logic errors
   - Review error handling and edge cases
   - Assess performance implications
   - Verify security considerations

2. **Architecture & Design**:
   - Evaluate code organization and structure
   - Check adherence to design patterns
   - Assess separation of concerns
   - Review API design and interfaces
   - Consider maintainability and extensibility

3. **Best Practices**:
   - Verify naming conventions
   - Check for code duplication
   - Review comment quality and documentation
   - Assess test coverage and quality
   - Ensure consistent coding style

4. **Language-Specific Checks**:
   - **JavaScript/TypeScript**: ESLint rules, type safety, async/await usage
   - **Python**: PEP 8 compliance, type hints, exception handling
   - **Go**: Go conventions, error handling, goroutine safety
   - **Rust**: Ownership patterns, error handling, performance
