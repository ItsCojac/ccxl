Analyze the logs for: $ARGUMENTS

Please help me debug by:

1. **Finding relevant log files** - Look for application logs, error logs, or system logs
2. **Parsing log entries** - Extract timestamps, error levels, and messages
3. **Identifying patterns** - Look for recurring errors, performance issues, or anomalies
4. **Correlating events** - Connect related log entries across different files/services
5. **Suggesting fixes** - Provide specific recommendations based on the log analysis

Focus on:
- Error messages and stack traces
- Performance bottlenecks
- Unusual patterns or spikes
- Missing or incomplete operations
- Security-related events

If you need to examine specific log files, ask me to specify the paths or use common locations like:
- `/var/log/`
- `./logs/`
- Application-specific log directories
